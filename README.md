# skyline-problem

Uses the solution from the Algorithms - Java project: [SkylineProblem](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Java/tree/master/SkylineProblem).

The problem is explained here: [Divide and Conquer | Set 7 (The Skyline Problem)](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/divide-and-conquer-set-7-the-skyline-problem/). In fact, the demonstration data set comes from the article.

```json
{ 
  (1,11,5), 
  (2,6,7), 
  (3,13,9), 
  (12,7,16), 
  (14,3,25),
  (19,18,22), 
  (23,13,29), 
  (24,4,28) 
}
```

The following illustration presents our visualization. On the left are each of the buildings; where visible and non visible portions are shown. On the right is the silhouette or skyline, where the solution is plotted as a set of points.
